 . model is V = 1 / (D + K)
  . in the spec, K = 0.42 but it depends on the sharp model + calibration data

. introduction
 . http://www.instructables.com/id/Structured-Light-3D-Scanning/
 . the basic idea behind 3d scanners
  . if we have a lighted ball and 2 camera
  . if the 2 camera see the ball
  . if we know the 2 camera angles
  . if we know the distance between camera
  . then by triangulation, we can know D, the distance with the object
   . this is called triangulation, same process used in sharps
  . if we replace one of the camera by a laser, same process except the
  object looked for is not the ball, but a laser point
  . if we move the laser, we can create a line: the scanline
   . acquistion time is much faster
  . if we project a bunch of lines at a time, the acquisition time is now
  reduced. there is no need for multiple lasers: the same effect can be
  achieved by playing with light patterns: this is called structured light
