. software chain
 . in a first time, the scanning program will be implemented as a toolchain.
 In next version a gui will avoid the command line usage.

 . scanning is done by creating a new project. a project is first initialized
 with default settings that can be changed by the user. Then calibration and
 scanning sequences  are acquired. If not yet done, a calibration step must
 performed. Scanning is  finally done and outputs a pointcloud into a given
 directory. The toolchain consists of the following programs:
  . init projname
   . initialize a directory for the project projname
  . capture projname {calib,scan}
   . capture calibration and scanning sequences for the projname
  . calib projname
  . scan projname

 . the projname directory is structured as followed:
  . config
  . extrinsic
  . intrinsic
  . calib/{000000, 000001, ...}.jpg
  . scan/{000000, 000001, ...}.jpg
  . cloud.asc
  . cloud.vrml

 . the resulting cloud can then be processed using a cloud edition program,
  for instance meshlab.

 . not that some calibration files can be shared across projects
